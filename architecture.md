# Cloud Storage Service Architecture

## System Overview
A cloud-based personal data storage service that allows storing various types of data (text, images, sounds, documents) organized by user-defined indexes, with chronological listing and search capabilities.

## Core Components

### 1. API Layer (Flask)
- RESTful API endpoints for:
  - User authentication
  - Index management (CRUD operations)
  - Data entry management (upload, retrieve, delete)
  - Search operations
- JWT-based authentication
- Rate limiting and request validation

### 2. Storage Layer (MongoDB Atlas)

#### File Storage (GridFS)
- Automatic file chunking for large files
- Built-in streaming capabilities
- Metadata storage with each file
- Efficient retrieval and range queries
- Organized by user and index collections

#### Data Schema
```javascript
// Collections:

Users {
    _id: ObjectId,
    username: String,
    password_hash: String,
    created_at: Date
}

Indexes {
    _id: ObjectId,
    user_id: ObjectId,
    name: String,
    description: String,
    created_at: Date
}

Entries {
    _id: ObjectId,
    index_id: ObjectId,
    user_id: ObjectId,
    type: String,  // 'text', 'image', 'sound', 'document'
    content: String,        // For text entries
    file_id: ObjectId,      // Reference to GridFS file if type != 'text'
    metadata: {
        filename: String,
        contentType: String,
        size: Number,
        customMetadata: Object
    },
    keywords: [String],     // For search optimization
    created_at: Date
}

// GridFS automatically creates fs.files and fs.chunks collections
// for storing file data and metadata

// Database Abstraction Layer
- Repository pattern implementation
- Interface-based design for database operations
- Database-agnostic service layer
- Data migration tools and utilities
```

#### File Handling Strategy
- Text entries stored directly in Entries collection
- Binary files (images, sounds, documents) stored in GridFS
- Automatic file streaming for large files
- Efficient partial file retrieval
- Built-in file deduplication

### 3. Search Layer (MongoDB Text Search)
- MongoDB text indexes for:
  - Full text content (for text entries)
  - File metadata
  - Custom keywords
- Support for:
  - Full-text search using MongoDB `$text` operator
  - Keyword-based search
  - Date range queries

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
```
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/refresh
```

### Indexes
```
GET    /api/indexes
POST   /api/indexes
GET    /api/indexes/{index_id}
PUT    /api/indexes/{index_id}
DELETE /api/indexes/{index_id}
```

### Entries
```
GET    /api/indexes/{index_id}/entries
POST   /api/indexes/{index_id}/entries
GET    /api/indexes/{index_id}/entries/{entry_id}
DELETE /api/indexes/{index_id}/entries/{entry_id}
GET    /api/indexes/{index_id}/search?q={query}
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Token refresh mechanism
- Role-based access control

### Data Security
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- MongoDB security features:
  - TLS/SSL encryption
  - Database encryption at rest
  - Role-based access control
- Secure file handling with GridFS
- Input validation and sanitization
- Environment-based configuration with .env files

### API Security
- Request validation and error handling
- CORS configuration
- Secure file upload handling
- JWT token validation

## Scalability Considerations

### Database Independence & Data Portability

#### Abstraction Layer
- Repository Pattern implementation separating business logic from data access
- Interface-based design for database operations (DatabaseProvider)
- Database-agnostic service layer
- Standardized data models (Entry, Index, User)

#### Data Migration & Export
- Structured data models for easy migration
- Clear separation of concerns in data layer
- Database provider interface for easy database switching
- GridFS for efficient file storage and retrieval

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless API design
- Docker containerization support
- MongoDB replication support
- Containerized testing environment

### Performance Optimization
- Pagination for large result sets
- Efficient file handling with GridFS
- MongoDB indexing for:
  - Text search
  - User queries
  - Index lookups
- Connection pooling

## Monitoring & Logging
- MongoDB monitoring:
  - Query performance
  - Connection monitoring
  - Storage metrics
- Application logging:
  - Request logging
  - Error tracking
  - Authentication events
  - File operations logging
- Test coverage reporting with Codecov
- GitHub Actions workflow monitoring

## Development & Deployment

### Containerization
- Docker support for development and testing
- Docker Compose configurations:
  - Development environment (docker-compose.yml)
  - Testing environment (docker-compose.test.yml)
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimized builds

### CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Automated testing on push and pull requests
- Code quality checks:
  - Linting with flake8
  - Test coverage reporting
- Test suite runs:
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - File upload tests
- MongoDB service container for tests

### Configuration Management
- Environment-based configuration (.env files)
- Separate test configuration (.env.test)
- Example configuration templates
- Secure credential management

### Testing Infrastructure
- Comprehensive test suite with pytest
- Test coverage reporting
- Fixture-based test setup
- Mock database for testing
- File upload testing utilities
